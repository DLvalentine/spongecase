Ruby string method to make your strings sArCaStIc :fire: 


This repo contains the gemspec and the spongecase.rb file. 

## Installation
`gem install spongecase` woot woot

## Why?
Mainly for the lols. But also because I wanted to learn how to publish a gem.

Whipped this bad boy up in 5 minutes. Maybe one day I'll make a cowsay clone with this.... or Spongebob Ipsum text. The uses for this are endless, I promise you.

## Build...?
Local: 

1. cd into spongecase
2. gem build spongecase.gemspec
3. gem install spongecase-1.0.1.gem

Then BAM you can require it in your projects. glhf.


Example:

```ruby
require 'spongecase'

"Wow this party is great".spongecase

# output
"WoW tHiS pArTy iS gReAt" 
```
