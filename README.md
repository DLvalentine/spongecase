This repo contains the gemspec and the spongecase.rb file. 

## Installation
`gem install spongecase` woot woot

then throw that bad boy in your gemfile so you can require it all over the place

## Why?
Mainly for the lols. But also because I wanted to learn how to publish a gem and play with Travis CI.

Whipped this bad boy up in 5 minutes. Maybe one day I'll make a cowsay clone with this.... or Spongebob Ipsum text. The uses for this are endless, I promise you.

## Usage

```ruby
require 'spongecase'

'this is a useful gem'.spongecase

# output
'tHiS iS a uSeFuL gEm' 
```
